# TicTacToe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ that allows you to play against the computer, which uses the Minimax algorithm.

The 'algo' boolean variable indicates which player begins. The cases of the game's board are numbered from 0 to 8, from left to right and from top to bottom. When it's your turn, just enter the number and press enter.
